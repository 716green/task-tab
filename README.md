# Unnamed utility

> Could be backslash V3?

<p>
  This started out as a project for me to stay comfortable with React while I work way too outrageous hours using Vue at work. While working on it, I had an idea to add a few other useful features that you need to plan your actual day outside of the screen, such as weather, themes to consider like "be less verbose", todos, and reminders.
